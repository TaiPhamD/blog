Secure Boot has becoming more popular in the past few years in the consumer PC segment due to the new windows 11 secure boot requirement. I wanted to explore more in detail on how UEFI Secure Boot works and how to implement part of this Security validation process using Python as proof of concept.

Following this [tutorial]((https://github.com/perez987/OpenCore-UEFI-Secure-Boot)), I have successfully enrolled my own certificate for self-signing the [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) bootloader to support Secure Boot.
